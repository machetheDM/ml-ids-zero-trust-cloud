## Detected cloud network intrusions at 98.1% accuracy with a 1.8% false-positive rate — then continued the research beyond its academic scope into the MLOps layer a real deployment needs: experiment tracking, a model registry, containerised inference and drift monitoring.

A continuation of the **Module 9 Research Project** from ECCU500 (Managing Secure Network Systems). The research answered the academic question; this repository answers the engineering one — a model is only useful once something can serve it, version it and tell you when it starts to drift. The false-positive rate is the number that decides whether a SOC team keeps a detector switched on at all.

Five models trained on the NSL-KDD benchmark (148,517 network flow records, 25 features), each mapped to NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust enforcement pillars:

| Rank | Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 | FPR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **LSTM** | **98.1%** | **98.3%** | **97.9%** | **98.1%** | **1.8%** |
| 2 | XGBoost | 97.3% | 97.5% | 97.1% | 97.3% | 1.9% |
| 3 | Random Forest | 96.8% | 97.1% | 96.2% | 96.6% | 2.1% |

*The false-positive rate is the number that matters operationally — a 98% accurate detector that floods analysts with false alarms gets switched off. Full evaluation, ROC curves and per-attack-class breakdown in [Results](#results).*

## Overview

### Why This Project Exists

This repository was built as the capstone project for **ECCU500: Managing Secure Network Systems**, a core course in the **MSc Cybersecurity (Cloud Security Architecture)** programme at EC-Council University. The assignment: design and implement a machine learning-based intrusion detection system and integrate it within a Zero Trust Architecture framework — demonstrating mastery of both cybersecurity domain knowledge and applied machine learning.

The project draws on two disciplines:
- **Cybersecurity** (ECCU MSc) — Zero Trust Architecture (NIST SP 800-207), intrusion detection, SOC operations, cloud network security, threat modelling across five ZTA pillars (Identity, Devices, Networks, Applications, Data)
- **Data Science & ML** (UEL MSc + Regenesys PGDip) — supervised and unsupervised ML, deep learning (LSTM, Autoencoder), feature engineering (RFECV, SMOTE), model evaluation (ROC, cross-validation, FPR optimisation)

### What It Does

Five ML algorithms — Random Forest, SVM, LSTM, Autoencoder, and XGBoost — are trained on the NSL-KDD benchmark dataset (148,517 network flow records) to classify traffic as normal or malicious. Each model is mapped to one or more of the five NIST ZTA enforcement pillars, and a six-phase implementation roadmap structures deployment from foundation to full operationalisation. The best-performing model (LSTM) achieves **98.1% accuracy with only 1.8% false positive rate** — directly addressing the SOC alert fatigue problem that costs organisations millions annually.

### Beyond the Paper

While the research paper satisfies the ECCU500 academic requirement, this repository goes further by adding a production MLOps layer — MLflow experiment tracking, model registry, containerised FastAPI inference serving, PSI-based drift monitoring, and a CI/CD pipeline — to demonstrate how a research model transitions to a deployed, monitored production system.

## Zero Trust Framework

This research embeds ML-IDS within the five pillars defined in NIST SP 800-207:

1. **Identity** -- UEBA and LSTM temporal anomaly detection for credential abuse and insider threats
2. **Devices** -- Random Forest classification of endpoint telemetry for device trust scoring
3. **Networks** -- RF, XGBoost, and LSTM ensemble for east-west traffic intrusion detection
4. **Applications** -- Autoencoder unsupervised anomaly detection for zero-day and API threats
5. **Data** -- Autoencoder ensemble for exfiltration detection and DLP integration

## Problem → Technique → Result

### The Problem
Cloud security incidents cost organisations USD 4.88 million per breach (IBM 2024). Security Operations Centre (SOC) teams are overwhelmed by false-positive alerts from traditional rule-based intrusion detection systems. The Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) framework (NIST SP 800-207) requires continuous verification, but existing IDS solutions cannot adapt to evolving attack patterns without manual rule updates.

### Techniques Used
- **Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras):** LSTM network (2-layer, 128 units, dropout=0.3, Adam optimiser, early stopping patience=5) for temporal anomaly detection in network traffic sequences
- **Ensemble ML (scikit-learn + XGBoost):** Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost classifiers with `GridSearchCV` hyperparameter tuning, compared against LSTM and Autoencoder
- **Data Preprocessing (pandas + scikit-learn):** One-hot encoding of categorical features (protocol_type, service, flag), `MinMaxScaler` normalisation, SMOTE oversampling for class imbalance, RFECV with RandomForest estimator to select top 25 features from 41 original
- **Evaluation:** 10-fold stratified cross-validation, metrics computed: Accuracy, Precision (weighted), Recall (weighted), F1-Score (weighted), False Positive Rate, training time, inference latency
- **Visualisation (matplotlib + seaborn):** 9 publication-quality figures at 300 DPI — model comparison bar charts, ROC curves, confusion matrices, feature importance, ZTA pillar diagrams
- **Framework Integration:** Each ML model mapped to one or more of the 5 NIST SP 800-207 ZTA pillars (Identity, Devices, Networks, Applications, Data) with a 6-phase implementation roadmap

### The Result
- **LSTM achieved 98.1% accuracy and 1.8% FPR** — best performer across all 5 models on NSL-KDD (148,517 records, 25 features)
- **Directly reduces SOC alert fatigue** — 1.8% false positive rate means analysts spend less time chasing false alarms
- **Reproducible research pipeline** — 5 Jupyter notebooks from EDA to evaluation, all models serialised and reusable
- **ZTA implementation roadmap** — 6-phase deployment plan from foundation to full operationalisation, with ML models mapped to specific ZTA enforcement layers
- **Module 9 Research Project** — ECCU500: Managing Secure Network Systems, EC-Council University

## MLOps Pipeline

This project implements a full MLOps lifecycle beyond the research notebook phase:

### Experiment Tracking (MLflow)

All 5 models are trained with MLflow tracking enabled. Each run logs:
- **Hyperparameters** — exact values from the research paper (§5.3)
- **Metrics** — accuracy, precision, recall, F1, FPR, training time
- **Cross-validation** — 10-fold stratified CV mean ± std (RF, XGBoost)
- **Artifacts** — serialised model files (.pkl / .h5)
- **Training history** — per-epoch loss curves (LSTM)

```bash
python src/train_mlflow.py              # train all 5 models
python src/train_mlflow.py --model lstm  # train single model
mlflow ui --port 5000                    # launch tracking UI
```

### Model Registry

Each model is registered in the MLflow Model Registry with versioning:
- `RandomForestIDS` — Random Forest (200 trees, Gini)
- `SVMIDS` — Support Vector Machine (RBF, C=10)
- `LSTMIDS` — LSTM (2-layer, 128 units) — **best performer**
- `AutoencoderIDS` — Autoencoder (41→32→16→8)
- `XGBoostIDS` — XGBoost (500 estimators)

### Inference API (FastAPI)

Production-ready REST API for model inference:

```bash
uvicorn api.serve:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/health` | GET | Model availability + uptime |
| `/models` | GET | List all models with metadata |
| `/predict` | POST | Batch classification (n samples × 25 features) |
| `/predict/single` | POST | Single flow classification |

Interactive docs available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Containerised Deployment

```bash
docker build -t ml-ids-inference -f api/Dockerfile .
docker run -p 8000:8000 ml-ids-inference
```

---

## Drift Monitoring

Continuous monitoring for model degradation in production:

### Data Drift (PSI)

Population Stability Index computed per feature comparing reference (training) vs current (production) distributions:

| PSI Range | Status | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| < 0.10 | ✅ Stable | No action needed |
| 0.10 – 0.25 | ⚠️ Warning | Investigate feature |
| > 0.25 | 🚨 Critical | Retrain may be required |

### Prediction Drift

Monitors shifts in the attack/normal prediction ratio. A >10pp shift triggers an alert for potential concept drift or new attack patterns.

### Performance Degradation

When ground-truth labels become available (e.g., SOC analyst feedback), compares current accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 against reference benchmarks.

### Drift Dashboard (Streamlit)

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/drift_app.py
```

Features:
- Overall drift status cards (status, features drifted, attack rate shift, accuracy delta)
- PSI bar chart — top 15 drifted features with warning/critical thresholds
- Drift progression over time (multi-window simulation)
- Prediction distribution comparison (reference vs current pie charts)
- Performance degradation bar chart

### CI/CD Integration

The `.github/workflows/ml-pipeline.yml` runs on every push to `main` and weekly on schedule:
1. **Preprocess** — data pipeline
2. **Train** — MLflow-tracked training of all 5 models
3. **Evaluate** — benchmark validation against paper results (±2pp tolerance)
4. **Drift** — 5-window drift simulation
5. **Build** — Docker image build + health check
